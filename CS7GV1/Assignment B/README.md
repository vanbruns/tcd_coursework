# TCD-CV-AssignmentB

HTML format for Assignment B of Computer Vision at Trinity College Dublin Fall 2019. 

1. MNIST Classification<br/>
2. Image Denoising<br/>
3. Semantic Segmentation<br/>

Due to code dependencies for files provided for the course (unmanaged by me), only the HTML format for the Jupyter notebook files are included. These show coding work for the assignment, and subsequent output. GitHub doesn't preview HTML, so the files will have to be downloaded to be viewed.
